## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser and a way to serve the files locally. A simple way is to use a code editor extension like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VS Code.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/type.bro.git
    cd type.bro
    ```

2.  **Run the application**
    - Open the project folder in your code editor.
    - Right-click on `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server" (or your equivalent).

The app should now be running in your browser!

### Configuration (For Gemini API)

The "quote" typing mode uses the Google Gemini API to generate unique quotes. For this feature to work, the application requires a Google Gemini API key.

- The application is designed to read the API key from an environment variable: `process.env.API_KEY`.
- In the current simple setup (serving static HTML), this environment variable will not be available, and the quote feature will gracefully fall back to a default placeholder text.
- To enable the Gemini API functionality during local development, you would need to use a build tool like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) which can manage and inject environment variables into the application.
